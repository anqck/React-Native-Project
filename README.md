# Location Notifier

[Location Notifier](https://github.com/manhquynh-github/React-Native-Project) is a simple cross-platform mobile app that uses [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) framework. The app will notify a user whenever he/she is about to reach a set destination. Moreover, this app supports organizing a favorite list, searching for nearby gas stations or local ATMs. There are also settings to control the alarm. This is useful for those who travel a lot, especially students that don't know if they are close to the destination or may oversleep on the bus.
