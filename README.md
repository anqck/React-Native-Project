## 2. Getting Started

**a. Setup with React Native Expo app**

*Install Expo*

```js
npm install -g expo-cli
```
*Download project & install package*<br />

```js
git clone https://github.com/manhquynh-github/React-Native-Project.git
cd React-Native-Project.git
yarn install
```

You've successfully setup [Notify Location](https://github.com/manhquynh-github/React-Native-Project) with your [React Native Expo Project](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app. Your React Native app is now all set to run on Android simulator.


**b. Setup with browser expo**

You can run the following command to create the boilerplate.

Go to app location
```sh
cd React-Native-Project
```

For Android run
```sh
expo start
```
Connect your android device or turn on emulator
```sh
Choose Local in CONNECTION Menu
Click Run on Android device/ emulator
```

Refer [expo-project](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) page for additional information

## 3. Components

[Expo](https://docs.expo.io) apps are React Native apps which contain the Expo SDK. The SDK is a native-and-JS library which provides access to the device's system functionality (things like the camera, contacts, local storage, and other hardware). That means you don't need to use Xcode or Android Studio, or write any native code, and it also makes your pure-JS project very portable because it can run in any native environment containing the Expo SDK.

[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is made from effective building blocks referred to as components. The Components are constructed in pure [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) platform along with some JavaScript functionality with rich set of customisable properties. These components allow you to quickly build the perfect interface.

[AsyncStorage](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage.html#asyncstorage) is a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app. It should be used instead of LocalStorage.

[MapView](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/map-view) A Map component that uses Apple Maps or Google Maps on iOS and Google Maps on Android. Expo uses react-native-maps at react-community/react-native-maps. No setup required for use within the Expo app, or within a standalone app for iOS. See below for instructions on how to configure for deployment as a standalone app on Android.
