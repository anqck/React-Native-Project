# Location Notifier

[Location Notifier](https://github.com/manhquynh-github/React-Native-Project) is a simple cross-platform mobile app that uses [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) framework. Our app aims to provide the ability of notifying a user whenever he/she is about to reach a set destination. Furthermore, this app supports organizing a favorite list, searching for nearby gas stations or local ATMs, and other related settings to control the alarm. This is useful for those who travel a lot, especially students that don't know if they are close to the destination or may oversleep on the bus.

cd React-Native-Project
yarn install
```

You have successfully set up [Location Notifier](https://github.com/manhquynh-github/React-Native-Project) in development mode. The app is now all ready to run on any mobile devices/emulators.

## Setup with browser expo (**_outdated_**)

_This part is outdated, update coming soon._

You can run the following command to create the boilerplate.

Go to app location

# Components

> [Expo](https://docs.expo.io) apps are React Native apps which contain the Expo SDK. The SDK is a native-and-JS library which provides access to the device's system functionality (things like the camera, contacts, local storage, and other hardware). That means you don't need to use Xcode or Android Studio, or write any native code, and it also makes your pure-JS project very portable because it can run in any native environment containing the Expo SDK.

> [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/) is made from effective building blocks referred to as components. The Components are constructed in pure [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) platform along with some JavaScript functionality with rich set of customisable properties. These components allow you to quickly build the perfect interface.

> [AsyncStorage](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage.html#asyncstorage) is a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app. It should be used instead of LocalStorage.

> [MapView](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/map-view) A Map component that uses Apple Maps or Google Maps on iOS and Google Maps on Android. Expo uses react-native-maps at react-community/react-native-maps. No setup required for use within the Expo app, or within a standalone app for iOS. See below for instructions on how to configure for deployment as a standalone app on Android.

> [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
> (Not to be confused with a WordPress framework â€“ Redux Framework.)

> [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) Persist and rehydrate a redux store.

> [MapServiceBackground](https://github.com/mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation) This plugin can be used for geolocation when the app is running in the foreground or background. [DEMO & Fork](https://github.com/ductienuit/DemoMapService)
